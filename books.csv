1,"and gall- bladder disease (GD) are members of metabolic syndromein morbidly obesity. Insulin resistance is a risk factor for NASH and GD. The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between insulin resistance(HOMA-IR), liver fibrosis, NASH and GD in morbidly obese patients who presented with fatty liver during preoperative abdominal ultrasonography examination. Methods We stud"
2,"ied 152 morbid obese patients with fatty liver disease including 54 with NASH, 11 with GD and two with concurrent NASH and GD that were undergoinglaparoscopic bariatric surgery. Clinical data (gender, age, body mass index [BMI], and associated diseases), labora- tory evaluation, and histopathology were obtained from thepatient databases. We analyzed the relationship between clinical characteristic"
3,"s, histological parameters, HOMA-IR,and fibrosis stage associated with NASH and GD in morbid obese patients. Results Among the 152 patients with fatty liver disease, 93 were females and 59 were males. The mean age was 30.3±8.9 years and the mean BMI was 44.9±5.4 kg/m 2. Fifty- four patients (54/152, 35.5%) were diagnosed as NASH and 11 patients (11/152, 7.2%) received concomitant lapa-roscopic cho"

Morbidly obese patients with fatty liver disease and GD were significantly older ( P=0.020), had higher serum levels of cholesterol ( P=0.020) and low-density lipopro- tein (LDL)-cholesterol ( P=0.044), and had lower serum levels of total bilirubin ( P=0.044), C-peptide ( P=0.023), and insulin ( P=0.039) than the NASH group.

[ 1], is part of a broad spectrum of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ranging from hepatic steatosis, ballooning degeneration of hepatocytes, lobular inflammation to steatohepatitis, which shows progression toliver fibrosis"
12," [ 2–4]. The main risk factors associated with NASH include obesity, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, insulin resistance, and conditions associated withthe metabolic syndrome [ 5–7]. Gallbladder disease (GD) is highly prevalent in obese population [ 8–10]. Association of GD to metabolic syn- drome includes obesity, type II diabetes mellitus, dyslipi- demia and insulin resistance [ 11–14]."
13," A pathogenic link between low-grade systemic chronic inflammation, obesity,insulin resistance, NASH, and GD is interesting. As NASH and GD share many similar risk factors, it will be expected that insulin resistance may be an important factor in bothNASH [ 15,16] and GD [ 17]. However, a few controversial studies have been reported to identify the possible asso- ciation of NASH and GD [ 18,19]. T"
14,"he prevalence and multiple risk factor analysis associated with GD observed in NASH patients in obese population have rarely been in- vestigated. A previous study in Asian population [ 20] sug- gested that chronic liver disease, particularly liver cirrhosis, was a risk factor for cholecystolithiasis. Fibrosis is thoughtto be a disease resulting from NASH. The relationship of liver fibrosis stage r"
15,"egarding to the factors associated with the presence of NASH and GD in obese population is stillunknown. Furthermore, it is unclear whether NASH patients who also have concurrent GD have any specific metabolic risk factors. The purpose of this study was to identify the prevalence and risk factors associated with GD and NASH in morbid obesity presented with fatty liver during preoperative abdo-mina"

Materials and Methods Study Design, Patient Selection, and Serological Testing The retrospective study was performed with the approval of the ethic committee. From 2003 to 2005, a total of 152 morbid obese patients with fa"
17,"tty liver diagnosed duringpreoperative abdominal ultrasonography examination un- dergoing laparoscopic weight reduction surgery were consecutively enrolled. Part of the database was publishedpreviously [ 21 ]. All patients gave written informed consent for participation. Patients with a history of obesity of >5 years' duration, BMI>40 kg/m2with comorbidities, documented weight-loss attempts in the"
18," past, and good motivation for surgery were submitted in our study. The preoperative assessment included a clinical and familialassessment, a psychiatric assessment, anthropometric meas- urements, and laboratory tests. An assessment of alcohol consumption was obtained at the surgical consultation.Laboratory tests included liver function tests, fasting lipid profiles, fasting glucose profile, fasti"
19,"ng insulin, C-peptide, HbA1c, adiponectin, HOMA-IR=(fasting insulin [ μIU/mL]× fasting glucose [mmol/L] / 22.5), hepatitis B and C serology (HBsAg, HBV DNA, and antibody to HCV). In this study, we decided to use a HOMA-IR of more than 2.0 as thecriterion to represent insulin resistance [ 22]. Laparoscopic wedge-resected liver biopsies were taken as a routine part of the operative procedure in all "
20,152 obese patients. Patients with intraoperative findings of gallstones were undergone concomitant cholecystectomy. Pathological Assessment All liver biopsies were fixed and examined using hematox- ylin–eosin and the Periodic-acid Schiff with diastase stain for necroinflammatory grading.

Fibrosis Stage, Degree of HOMA-IR in NASH Versus Gallbladder Disease (GD) Obesity, NASH, and gallbladder disease are tightly related to insulin resistance. It is unknown whether liver fibrosis isassociated with insulin resistan"
40,"ce in NASH and GD groups. Therefore, we further assessed the HOMA-IR (quartiles of HOMA) distribution and the relationship between fibrosisstage in patients with NASH and GD. In the NASH group, HOMA-IR distribution progressively decreased when the severity of fibrosis was plotted as a function of insulinresistance (Fig. 1). The first quartile of HOMA-IR showed significantly different ( r=0.567, P="
41,"0.039) between two different groups. Discussion In obese population, systemic chronic inflammatory status is believed to play an important role in the pathogenesis ofsteatohepatitis, atherosclerosis, cardiovascular diseases and gallbladder disease [ 25–27]. The prevalence of NASH and gallbladder disease was 33.8% [ 21] and 10.1% [ 28], respec- tively, among obese population in Asia. In this study,"
42," we first compared the clinical risk factors between NASH and gallbladder disease among morbid obesity that hadfatty liver disease undergoing bariatric surgery. Gallbladder disease among morbidly obese patients with fatty liver weresignificantly older, had higher serum levels of cholesterol and LDL cholesterol and had lower serum levels of total bilirubin,C-peptide, and insulin than the NASH group"
43,". Our study con- firmed that age was a common risk factor associated with gallbladder disease in general and obese populations. In ad-dition, the present study supported the existence of a more important pathogenic link between gallbladder disease and serum cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels. The mostimportant pathogenic event in gallstone formation is the secretion of hepatic bile supersatura"
44,"ted with cholesterol, and hypersecretion of biliary cholesterol is the most com-mon cause of lithogenic bile in humans. It has been well- known that bile acid synthesis significantly correlates with very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) production. Hyper-insulinemia has shown to be associated with increased risk of gallstones. Insulin may play a role in gallstone forma- tion by two mechanisms: incre"
45,"asing cholesterol saturationof bile and decreasing gallbladder motility. Insulin also acti- vates low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver, thereby increasing cholesterol excretion in the bile. An as-sociation of gallbladder disease with higher fasting serum insulin and C-peptide levels in normal BMI women was reported from a large, national, population-based sample[29]. Although the a"
46,"ssociation of gallbladder disease with insulin and C-peptide level was less significant when com- pared with the NASH group in our study, this observationmay suggest that diabetes appears to be a risk factor for both gallbladder disease and NASH, regardless of the pre- sence of other factors. The failure of control group study toaccount for the association of diabetes, gallbladder disease, and NAS"
47,"H is one of the limitations of this study. On the other hand, the histopathology findings of steatosis, bal-looning degeneration of hepatocytes, lobular inflammation, glycogenated nuclei, and fibrosis stage were different Fig. 1 Distribution of HOMA-IR according tofibrosis stage in NASH andGallbladder Disease (GD). No difference was observed in GD group, whereas the severityof HOMA-IR was decrease"

We have failed to demonstrate any significantly risk factor regardingto the histopathology of gallbladder between NASH and gallbladder disease. On the contrary, we did not observe any significantly different in the liver function test, b"
49,"lood pres-sure, high-sensitivity CRP, and adiponectin level between NASH and gallstone disease. We next analyzed the histological features of liver and gallbladder in obese patients with gallstone disease. Most morbidly obese patients pre sent mild steatosis, mild ballooning degeneration, mild lobular inflammation, mildportal inflammation, and mild fibrosis in their liver biopsy specimens [ 30]. T"
50,"he resected gallbladder specimens display acute and chronic inflammatory infiltrate, mild cholester-olosis, and minimal gastric metaplasia. The prevalence of NASH in GD of our morbidly obese population was 18%, which was similar to the prevalence reported by Loria P etal. in normal BMI general population [ 19]. Uric acid and apolipoprotein-B were found to be associated with the gallstone disease i"
51,n nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in thisprevious study. A previous report among Chinese in Taiwan demonstrated that the prevalence of concurrent gallstone and fatty liver was 6.5% [ 18]. A previous epidemiology study of comorbidity of liver and gallstone disease in a large population [ 31] reported that cholelithiasis occurred in 13.7% of patients with nonalcoholic liver cirrhosis. Other risk fa
52,"ctors for cholelithiasis besides liver disease were female gender, older age, Native American or Hispanicethnicity, and presence of diabetes mellitus. In our current study, we only enrolled two patients with concurrent NASH and gallbladder disease. Interestingly, we observed anincrease of HOMA-IR in patients with concurrent NASH- GD than NASH ( P=0.040). This may explain the important role of insu"
53,"lin resistance in these two diseases. However,given the relatively limited sample size, further studies are needed in a larger cohort to address this interesting issue. The prevalence of chronic hepatitis B in gallbladder disease in our study was 18%. The prevalence of HBsAg and chronic B hepatitis was 4.4 –4.5% in gallstone disease among normal BMI population in Taiwan [ 18]. A prospec- tive stud"
54,"y by Sheen and Liaw [ 20] showed a linear trend toward the prevalence of cholecystolithiasis increased with the progression of liver disease, i.e., from “healthy ”HBsAg carrier through chronic hepatitis to liver cirrhosis. Chronic hepatitis B seems to be a risk factor for gallbladder disease [28]. Paradoxically, chronic hepatitis B was not a risk factor in the development of NASH [ 21] and HBsAg-p"
55,"ositive sub- jects had less prevalence of metabolic syndrome than HBsAg- negative subjects [ 32]. Further longitudinal studies are indicated to verify the complex relationship between the role of hepatitis B viral replication, gallbladder disease, NASH, liver fibrosis, and metabolic syndrome in obese population.Insulin resistance is an important risk factor in NASH and gallbladder disease. The ass"
56,"ociation between insulin resistance and fibrosis in NASH and gallbladder diseaseremains unknown. Hyperinsulinemia induces hepatic stel- late cell proliferation, whereas high levels of glucose unregulated the expression of profibrogenic cytokines.Lipid peroxidation by-products and inflammatory cytokines released by injured cells have shown to act as paracrine mediators of hepatic stellate cell acti"
57,"vation. Therefore,hepatic fibrosis might be caused by complex independent risk factors of liver steatosis, insulin resistance, and systemic inflammatory cytokines production in NASH.On the other hand, several studies suggested that the risk of developing gallstones was correlated with the severity of liver cirrhosis as graded by the Child –Pugh classification [33]. In this study, performed in morb"
58,"id obese patients, we observed progressively decreased when the severity of fibrosis was plotted as a function of insulin resistance inNASH group. We could rarely observe any relationship between gallbladder disease, fibrosis stage, and insulin resistance. Mechanisms of this association are unclear. Fora better understanding of this complex relationship, further studies should be addressed to inve"
59,"stigate the coordinated control of energy metabolism and glucose and lipid homeostasis communication between liver and other organs. In conclusion, the prevalence of NASH in gallbladder disease was 18% in morbid obese patients. Age was a common risk factor associated with gallbladder disease innormal BMI and obese population. Serum cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels demonst"
60,"rated a more important pathogenic link to gallbladder disease thanNASH. Insulin resistance is more common in concurrent NASH and gallbladder disease. Insulin resistance seems to be a common pathogenic mechanism associated with hepatic fibrosis, but the mechanism between NASH and gallbladder disease is unknown. References 1.
